  <h2>What is Pandabuy?</h2>
  <p>Pandabuy is an e-commerce platform that was launched in 2017. The platform specializes in providing high-quality products at competitive prices. By allowing consumers to shop with Chinese providers, it enables customers to buy products at a more affordable price. The platform acts as a middleman for shoppers in other parts of the world to connect with Chinese manufacturers.</p>

  <p>PandaBuy works by connecting customers with Chinese suppliers. These suppliers sell anything from clothes, to shoes, to electronics. PandaBuy itself has a very simple platform to navigate where users can browse through products and purchase them.
